# Implementation Summary: Waterfall Chart Gross-to-Net Calculation Fix

## Ticket
修正瀑布图口径：应发→扣除→实际到手（应发排除福利与餐补）

## Objective
Align the waterfall chart's "gross income" (应发) definition with the homepage net amount display by excluding meal allowances and festival benefits.

## Changes Implemented

### Backend Changes (`backend/app/routes/stats.py`)

1. **New calculation function**: `_gross_income_for_net_charts()`
   - Calculates gross income excluding meal allowance and three festival benefits
   - Formula: base + performance + high_temp + low_temp + computer + other_income
   - Excludes: meal_allowance, mid_autumn_benefit, dragon_boat_benefit, spring_festival_benefit

2. **Updated endpoint**: `/stats/gross-vs-net/monthly`
   - Uses new `_gross_income_for_net_charts()` for gross calculation
   - Calculates net as `gross - deductions` directly
   - Ensures both gross and net include `other_income`
   - Added clear documentation in Chinese explaining the formula

### Frontend Changes

1. **WaterfallChart component** (`frontend/src/components/stats/WaterfallChart.vue`)
   - Added default note: "应发不包含餐补与三节福利"
   - Enhanced tooltip to show: "应发工资（不含餐补与福利）"
   - Users now see clear indication of what's excluded

2. **GrossVsNetBar component** (`frontend/src/components/stats/GrossVsNetBar.vue`)
   - Added matching note for consistency: "应发不包含餐补与三节福利"

### Testing (`backend/tests/test_gross_to_net_calculation.py`)

Created 6 comprehensive unit tests:
1. ✅ Test exclusion of meal allowance and festival benefits
2. ✅ Test handling of zero values
3. ✅ Test waterfall net calculation (gross - deductions)
4. ✅ Test monthly aggregation
5. ✅ Test annual aggregation with multiple festival months
6. ✅ Test other_income inclusion in both gross and net

**All tests pass successfully** ✅

## Calculation Formula

### Before Fix
```
Gross = base + performance + all_allowances + all_benefits + other
Net = _unified_net_income (excludes meal, benefits, other_income)
Issue: Inconsistent - gross included items that net didn't
```

### After Fix
```
Gross = base + performance + high_temp + low_temp + computer + other
        (excludes: meal, mid_autumn, dragon_boat, spring_festival)
        
Deductions = pension + medical + unemployment + critical_illness 
             + annuity + housing_fund + other_deductions
             
Net = Gross - Deductions
```

## Verification

✅ Backend unit tests pass (6/6)
✅ Backend app loads successfully
✅ Frontend builds without errors
✅ Calculation is consistent between charts
✅ User-facing documentation added via notes/tooltips

## Impact Assessment

### Directly Affected
- Waterfall Chart (应发 → 扣除 → 实际到手)
- Gross vs Net Bar Chart (应发 vs 实际到手)
- KPI Cards on Net Income page

### Not Affected
- Other endpoints using `_unified_net_income` remain unchanged
- Detail tables maintain existing calculations
- Other statistics views unaffected

## Files Modified
1. `backend/app/routes/stats.py` - Core calculation logic
2. `frontend/src/components/stats/WaterfallChart.vue` - UI clarifications
3. `frontend/src/components/stats/GrossVsNetBar.vue` - UI clarifications

## Files Added
1. `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test module initialization
2. `backend/tests/test_gross_to_net_calculation.py` - Unit tests
3. `backend/tests/README.md` - Test documentation
4. `WATERFALL_CHART_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed change summary

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Waterfall chart's "应发" excludes meal allowances and three festival benefits
✅ Consistent with homepage "实际到手金额" tab
✅ Formula clearly documented in code and UI
✅ Backend unit tests pass
✅ Frontend renders correctly with clarifying notes
✅ No console errors
✅ Matches detail table calculations

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. The changes:
- Are backwards compatible for other endpoints
- Have comprehensive test coverage
- Include clear user-facing documentation
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
